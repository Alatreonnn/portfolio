            <h2>Lie Flat!</h2>
            <p>"Lie Flat!" is my first independent work. It is a board game designed to discuss working status and
                mental stress of recent graduates in China. </p>
            <p>The core experiences of the game are the dual resource conversion and special event prediction.</p>

            <h2>House-tile Pets</h2>
            <p>"House-tile Pets" is my 2024 Gamejam work. This is a 2D shooting game developed in Unity for two players.
                Players act
                as cat or dog, fight to be the king of the house.</p>
            <p>In this project, I served as the lead designer and lead programmer, proposing the overall game framework
                while also
                implementing the player control system and the logic for bullets hitting and destroying obstacles.</p>

            <h2>Toughness system</h2>
            <h3>in Sword and Fairy</h3>
            <p>Designed a toughness system to handle hit reactions and attack priorities for "Sword and Fairy: Far
                Beyond Time", an ARPG with more than 1m subscriptions.</p>
            <p>Previously, the hit reactions in the game were triggered by fixed logic. As development
                progressed, there was an additional need to display the effects of attacks in the hit animations,
                necessitating a
                conditional assessment to determine which type of hit animation to play.</p>
            <p>I designed a dual-thread resilience display system, assigning values to each attack action and character
                hit resilience.
                When an attack is placed, the system plays the corresponding hit reaction based on the difference
                between the two values. This system boasts strong standardization and scalability, significantly
                simplifying processes
                and optimizing performance.</p>

            <h2>Xueya, the Blood Emissary</h2>
            <p>Designed Xueya, the final boss in the 2024.12 Patch for "JUSTICE ONLINE", the largest MMO in China.</p>
            <p>As the final boss of the raid, Xueya needs to be highlighted as a formidable opponent in the battle,
                while
                also balancing the needs of the narrative and the combat experience.</p>
            <p>For this purpose, I designed "Blade Spirits" as the core of the combat mechanics. Xueya summons different
                Blade
                Spirits in each phase of the fight, each with a unique style, providing a series of distinct combat
                experiences that are
                interconnected through his real body. Narratively, the Blade Spirits represent aspects of Xueya's psyche
                and are
                given independent thoughts in their design, which facilitates creative development by the writing team.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, for the first time, I integrated auditory elements as a combat element in "JUSTICE Online",
                creating a mechanism for
                identifying positions by sound. Xueya received widespread acclaim from players, focusing on the
                mechanics being
                interesting and the difficulty level being reasonable.</p>
